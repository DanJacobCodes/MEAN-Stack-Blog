<h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>I'm Dan Jacob, I'm an aspiring Web Developer and Designer! My journey to programming has been anything but linear, from pursuing a degree in Business to dropping it all to join a programming boot camp in Seattle, called Epicodus! I was inspired to make the change to development afer taking a Intro to C++ Programming class in college - as someone who has followed the tech industry closely, I decided I wanted to get my hands dirty. Over the course of a year, I've worked in pairs, groups, and individually to build web applications in agile environments.</p>
